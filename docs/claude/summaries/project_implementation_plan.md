# RAG Workspace - Implementation Plan Summary

## Project Overview

The RAG Workspace is a comprehensive platform designed to enable developers to interact with their codebases using AI. The system leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide context-aware AI responses based on project code and documentation.

## Core Features

- Multi-LLM support (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI API, Google Gemini)
- GitHub repository integration and analysis
- Azure File Share integration for persistent storage
- Qdrant for vector search and semantic retrieval
- Containerized architecture with Docker
- Next.js frontend with real-time streaming responses
- .NET 8 backend API

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- Repository structure and initial files
- Docker configuration (compose files, Dockerfiles)
- Environment configuration (.env.example)
- Azure File Share integration configuration

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
- .NET API project structure (controllers, services, interfaces)
- LLM services (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Gemini)
- File storage with Azure File Share
- Vector database using Qdrant
- Database models and EF Core configuration
- Real-time communication with SignalR

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
- Next.js application structure
- Chat interface with streaming support
- File explorer and upload functionality
- GitHub repository connection UI
- Authentication and session management

### Phase 4: Core Feature Implementation
- RAG pipeline for context-aware responses
- File ingestion and processing workflow
- GitHub integration for repo analysis
- User and project management

### Phase 5: Cloud Deployment
- Azure Container Apps deployment
- Azure resources provisioning
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
- Unit and integration tests
- API documentation
- User and developer guides

## Next Steps

1. Complete the environment setup with proper configuration
2. Begin backend API development with core interfaces
3. Implement the file storage and vector database services
4. Develop the chat functionality with RAG integration
5. Build the frontend UI with real-time features
