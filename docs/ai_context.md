Extended RAG Workspace with Gemini 2.5 Pro and GitHub Integration

RAG Co-Work Space ‚Äì Extended Architecture and Features
North Star Vision üåü
The North Star goal of this project is to create an AI pair-programmer that deeply understands an entire codebase and collaborates with developers in real-time. The system should boost developer productivity by handling tasks like project bootstrapping, code generation, and multi-file refactoring with full context awareness. In essence, it aims to be a ‚Äúcowork space‚Äù where an AI assistant can reason over your whole project, suggest changes or new code, and even manage code versioning ‚Äì all while seamlessly integrating with the developer‚Äôs workflow. This means an engineer can converse with the AI about any part of the project (even very large files or the entire repository) and receive context-aware suggestions, diffs, or explanations as if a knowledgeable teammate were always available.
Project Overview
RAG Co-Work Space is built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that combines a .NET backend (containerized) with a Next.js frontend and a Qdrant vector database for knowledge retrieval. It was initially designed to work with Azure OpenAI (e.g. GPT-4) for language generation and already supports multiple LLM providers (multi-LLM capability). In the current system, a typical query flows like this:
The user asks a question or gives an instruction in the Next.js frontend (e.g. ‚ÄúExplain the design of the payment module‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdd a function to calculate taxes in finance.py‚Äù).
The .NET backend retrieves relevant context from Qdrant (which stores embeddings of documentation, code snippets, etc.) using similarity search (the RAG retrieval step).
The backend calls an LLM (Azure OpenAI by default) with the user query plus retrieved context as prompt. The LLM generates a response (e.g. an answer or code change suggestion).
The response is streamed back to the frontend and displayed to the user, often with citations or references to source files if applicable.
This base architecture already helps ground the LLM‚Äôs responses on real project data to reduce hallucinations. Now, we are extending the architecture with several powerful features to achieve our North Star vision.
Extended Architecture Overview
The extended design introduces new components and integrations while building on the existing stack. Key enhancements include:
Integration with Google Gemini¬†2.5¬†Pro via Google‚Äôs API, adding a new LLM provider alongside Azure OpenAI. A routing mechanism will allow switching between Azure/OpenAI and Gemini on demand.
‚ÄúContext-Overloaded‚Äù RAG Pipeline to handle extremely large context windows (long files or entire repositories). This involves improved chunking/indexing of code and the ability to feed much larger combined context to models that support it (especially Gemini).
GitHub Integration for Codebase Awareness, enabling the AI to fetch and analyze repository data (files, directory structure, commit history) to provide context-aware code completions and even propose file edits or pull requests.
Persistent User/Agent Memory (optional) to maintain state across interactions. This could store conversation history or project-specific notes so the assistant remembers previous discussions, decisions, or user preferences beyond a single prompt‚Äôs context window.
Real-Time Collaboration Features, such as streaming token responses (so the user sees answers being generated live) and potential multi-user or co-editing support in the future (allowing a ‚Äúcollaborative notebook‚Äù or pair-programming session with the AI).
Below we outline each of these extensions in detail, including how they fit into the architecture and the engineering considerations for implementation.
Multi-LLM Routing with Gemini 2.5 Pro Integration
One major enhancement is the integration of Google‚Äôs Gemini¬†2.5¬†Pro model as an alternative backend for language generation. Gemini 2.5 Pro is a state-of-the-art multimodal LLM known for strong reasoning and coding capabilities
medium.com
. Notably, it supports an extremely large context window (up to ~1,048,576 tokens of input!)
cloud.google.com
, which far exceeds the typical 8k-32k token limits of models like GPT-4. This allows the system to feed very large amounts of context (potentially entire code files or multiple documents) into the model without truncation. How the Integration Works:
The .NET backend will include a new LLM Adapter for Gemini. This adapter interfaces with Google‚Äôs Vertex AI API to call the Gemini¬†2.5¬†Pro model. It will handle authentication (using Google Cloud credentials) and format requests according to Vertex API specifications (model name, temperature, etc.).
A Model Router in the backend will determine which LLM to use for a given request. This could be configured by the user (e.g., a dropdown in the UI to select ‚ÄúAzure GPT-4‚Äù vs ‚ÄúOpenAI GPT-4‚Äù vs ‚ÄúGoogle Gemini 2.5‚Äù) or determined dynamically (for instance, automatically route to Gemini if the requested context size is very large, or if the user specifically wants Google‚Äôs model). The routing logic ensures minimal changes to the rest of the system ‚Äì it picks the appropriate LLM adapter and forwards the prompt and context to it.
Unified Interface: To keep the code maintainable, the backend uses a unified interface or service for LLM calls (e.g., an ILLMClient interface with methods like GenerateCompletion(prompt, params)). Azure OpenAI, OpenAI API, and Gemini API each have their implementation of this interface. The rest of the system calls this interface without needing to know the details of each provider.
Gemini-Specific Binding Details: When routing to Gemini, the adapter will call the Vertex AI Generative Language API with the gemini-2.5-pro model ID in text completion or chat mode. We will need to handle some specifics, such as:
Token Limits: Ensuring the prompt size is within Gemini‚Äôs limits (which are very high) and possibly taking advantage of its large output limit (up to 65k tokens output
cloud.google.com
, useful for long code generation).
Multimodal Input: While Gemini can accept images, audio, etc., our initial focus is text (code and natural language). We will, however, design the interface such that adding image or audio context (e.g., a screenshot or diagram as part of a prompt) is possible in the future.
Rate Limits and Performance: The adapter will manage API quotas and error handling for Vertex AI calls. Gemini is powerful, but calls might have higher latency, so the system may allow configurable timeouts or fallbacks (for instance, if a Gemini call is too slow or fails, optionally retry or use another model).
Switchable Usage: The UI will clearly indicate which model is active for a session or query. For example, a user can select ‚ÄúGemini Pro‚Äù when they need to analyze a whole repository due to its large context window, and switch back to GPT-4 for other tasks if desired. In the future, we might even allow hybrid responses (e.g., use GPT-4 for some steps and Gemini for others in a multi-step workflow), but initially it will be one model at a time per query.
By integrating Gemini 2.5 Pro, our architecture becomes more versatile. We can leverage Gemini for its strengths (massive context and strong reasoning) while still using Azure/OpenAI models for their strengths (perhaps faster response in some cases or higher familiarity). The LLM Router and adapter pattern ensures this multi-LLM approach is extensible ‚Äì adding any new model in the future (Anthropic Claude, local models, etc.) would follow the same pattern without major changes to core logic.
Context-Overloaded RAG Pipeline (Large Contexts & Long Documents)
To support long files or even entire repositories as context, we are enhancing the RAG pipeline to handle ‚Äúcontext overload‚Äù ‚Äì meaning it can supply a lot more relevant information to the LLM when needed. This involves improvements in how we index, retrieve, and assemble context for the prompts:
Intelligent Chunking of Code and Documents: Large files (such as a 5,000-line code file or a lengthy markdown design doc) are split into semantically meaningful chunks for embedding storage. We use code-aware splitting strategies (potentially using syntax trees or section headers) so that chunks remain coherent (e.g., a function definition or a logical block of code isn‚Äôt split arbitrarily). This avoids feeding the LLM incomplete or meaningless code fragments, which can hurt performance
qodo.ai
.
Enhanced Embedding Index: All chunks are stored in the Qdrant vector database with embeddings. For code files in a repository, we also store metadata like file path, repository name, and perhaps commit hash (to ensure we can update or invalidate stale chunks if the file changes). The indexing pipeline will likely be extended to handle entire repositories by walking through the repo, chunking each file, and upserting into Qdrant. This process can be automated to run whenever a repo is connected or on a schedule to keep the index fresh
qodo.ai
.
Retrieval Strategies for Large Context: When a query comes in, instead of retrieving just a few top chunks as before, the system can retrieve a broader set of context if the target LLM can handle it (e.g., when using Gemini). For example, if a user asks, ‚ÄúRefactor the logging system across the project‚Äù, the backend might pull embeddings for all files related to logging (could be dozens of files). If using GPT-4 32k context, it might select the top few relevant snippets and perhaps summarize others. But if using Gemini with a 1M token window, the system could retrieve all relevant chunks (even 100k+ tokens worth of code) and include them in the prompt directly.
Dynamic Context Assembly: Depending on the chosen model‚Äôs context limit, the pipeline can operate in different modes:
Standard Mode: (for models with typical context) ‚Äî retrieve top N chunks (fit within 8k/32k tokens) and assemble prompt with those.
Extended Mode: (for large-context models like Gemini) ‚Äî retrieve many more chunks or even entire file contents. The prompt assembly might include a brief summary of each file followed by the full content, or the full content of critical files. We might also use hierarchical retrieval: e.g., first retrieve relevant file names, then for each file retrieve its content chunks.
Fallback Mode: if even 1M tokens isn‚Äôt enough (e.g., extremely large monolithic repos), we could do iterative prompting: for example, summarize parts of the context and then feed summaries along with key details. (This is a potential future enhancement for truly massive projects.)
Vertex AI RAG Engine (Optional): Google‚Äôs Vertex AI offers a built-in RAG Engine and context caching
cloud.google.com
. We will evaluate using Vertex‚Äôs RAG capabilities when Gemini is the model. This could allow the system to offload some RAG logic to Google‚Äôs platform, potentially simplifying how we manage citations and caches. However, initially we will likely handle RAG on our side (with Qdrant) for consistency across models.
Memory vs Retrieval: Note that this context retrieval is separate from the long-term memory component (discussed later). RAG retrieval brings in relevant project data for each query, whereas the memory system might store conversation or previous query results. Both will be used to augment prompts as needed.
By making the RAG pipeline scale to large contexts, the AI can effectively utilize the entire knowledge base of a project. This is crucial for tasks like understanding how a function interacts with the rest of the system or ensuring that code changes are consistent project-wide. With context-overloaded prompts, the assistant can cite facts or code from anywhere in the repo, leading to more accurate and holistic code generation. In practical terms, this means developers can ask high-level questions (covering many files) and get informed answers without manually opening those files themselves.
GitHub Integration & Project File Awareness
To achieve true project-wide intelligence, the system will integrate deeply with GitHub (or Git) to become aware of the repository‚Äôs structure and content. Inspired by tools like Claude‚Äôs code assistant (which can ingest entire codebases)
medium.com
medium.com
, our platform will treat the project‚Äôs repo as a first-class citizen in the AI‚Äôs context. Key aspects of the GitHub integration:
Repository Access: The user can connect a GitHub repository (via OAuth or by providing a repo URL and token). The backend can either use the GitHub API to fetch files or perform a one-time git clone of the repo into a workspace volume. For large repos, cloning might be more efficient. We will respect access permissions (e.g., a user‚Äôs personal or organization repos).
Indexing the Codebase: Once connected, an indexing job runs to process the repository:
It reads the directory tree and file list.
Each file‚Äôs content is chunked (as described in the RAG section) and embedded into Qdrant with tags for repo and file path.
We may also store a lightweight knowledge graph of the repo ‚Äì e.g., which files import or reference others, the module structure, etc., to help the AI understand relationships.
Optionally, store summaries of each file or module (e.g., using the LLM to summarize a file‚Äôs purpose and APIs) to use when high-level context is needed.
Real-Time Repo Updates: If the repository updates (through Git commits), the system can update the index. This could be done by a webhook from GitHub (if using GitHub, we can get commit events) or by polling. Changed files will be re-embedded, new files added, deleted files removed from Qdrant. This ensures the AI‚Äôs knowledge stays in sync with the latest code.
Contextual Retrieval by File Name or Path: Because the AI knows the repo structure, users can ask things like ‚ÄúOpen UserService.cs and add a new method for password reset‚Äù. The system will locate that file and include its content in the prompt. Even if the user doesn‚Äôt specify the file, the AI might identify relevant files: e.g., ‚ÄúAdd logging to all database calls‚Äù ‚Äì the assistant can search the index for files with database calls and retrieve them.
Awareness of Project Structure: The assistant will know the hierarchy of the project. For example, it will understand which directories contain front-end vs back-end code, or how microservices are separated. It can explain the architecture: ‚ÄúThe project is divided into web/, api/, and common/ modules‚Ä¶‚Äù. This is similar to Claude Code‚Äôs ability to maintain awareness of the entire project structure without manual input of files
medium.com
.
Code Generation and Edits with Full Context: With repository awareness, the AI can generate code that fits the project:
File creation: If asked to add a new component, the AI could suggest creating a new file in the appropriate directory, even providing the file‚Äôs content. (We would not auto-create the file on disk without user confirmation, but it can present the code.)
File modification: The AI can produce git diff style outputs or patch suggestions. For example, ‚ÄúRefactor the AuthController to use the new authentication service‚Äù could result in a diff across AuthController.cs and possibly other files it interacts with. The user could review the diff and apply it manually, or we can offer a one-click apply (with proper caution).
Multi-file consistency: The AI ensures that changes in one file are reflected in others. It can remind the user if a function signature is changed in one file, related calls in other files need updating (because it can search for those references in the index).
Git Operations: In later iterations, we plan to integrate actual Git operations:
The assistant could open a pull request with the proposed changes, or commit to a branch.
It could generate commit messages or even perform code reviews by comparing diffs and explaining the changes.
Safety measures will be in place: e.g., requiring user confirmation before any write operations to the repo, and clearly showing the diff.
Inspiration from Claude: Claude‚Äôs approach has shown that an AI that can ‚Äúanalyze project structures, edit files across multiple locations, manage git operations‚Äù provides a major productivity boost
medium.com
. Our architecture aims for similar capabilities by combining GitHub‚Äôs programmatic access with our RAG setup. Essentially, the vector index gives the AI the reading capability for the codebase, and the Git integration gives it writing and navigation capabilities. Together, this means the AI can not only answer questions about the code, but actually help modify the code in a context-aware way across the whole project.
This GitHub integration turns the RAG co-work space into a true file-aware coding assistant. It will feel to the developer like the AI has ‚Äúread‚Äù the entire repository (because in effect, it has indexed it), and it can draw on any part of it as needed. This dramatically expands the scope of assistance: from answering design questions to generating new code that fits in seamlessly, the AI coworker becomes deeply embedded in the project‚Äôs lifecycle.
Persistent Session Memory (User-Agent Memory)
In addition to retrieval of code and documents, we introduce an optional memory module to store information that should persist across user sessions or multiple interactions. While vector-based RAG deals with external knowledge (files, docs), the user-agent memory deals with the conversational or session knowledge that might not be explicitly in those files. The goal is to make the AI assistant more personalized and contextually aware over time. Features of the memory system:
Conversation History: The system can retain a summary or embedding of previous conversations with the user. For example, if a developer had a discussion yesterday about planning a new feature, and today they follow up with ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs implement that feature now‚Äù, the AI can recall what ‚Äúthat feature‚Äù refers to (using the stored summary of yesterday‚Äôs chat).
User Preferences & Style: Over time, the assistant can learn the developer‚Äôs coding style or preferences (for instance, their preference for functional programming, or a certain commenting style) and store these in memory. This can influence future suggestions to better match the user‚Äôs style.
Agent State and Goals: If we implement an agentic workflow (where the AI breaks down tasks or keeps track of a to-do list), this state can be stored. For example, if the AI is helping with a refactor that spans multiple steps, it can keep a list of files it plans to modify or tasks to complete, and check them off as done. This state could be stored in a structured form (like a JSON or in a small SQLite) and reloaded each session.
Technical Implementation: We could use a lightweight database or the existing Qdrant for storing these memories. One approach is to have a dedicated memory index in Qdrant per user (where conversation embeddings and notes are stored). Another approach is simply appending to a file or database record. To integrate with prompting, the system would retrieve the most relevant pieces of memory (similar to RAG) and prepend them as context (or as a system prompt like ‚ÄúThe user likes code style X, and has previously done Y‚Ä¶‚Äù).
Memory Controls: We will allow users to reset or clear the memory, and maybe to mark certain pieces of information as ‚Äúpersistent notes‚Äù (for instance, a user could tell the AI ‚ÄúRemember that our API keys should never be exposed in code‚Äù and this instruction can persist).
Privacy and Safety: Since this memory may contain sensitive data (code or discussions), it will be stored securely and only associated with the specific user. If using Qdrant for this, we‚Äôll segregate per user and encrypt if needed. Users should be informed that the AI remembers things unless they clear it, to avoid surprises.
This persistent memory transforms the system from a stateless Q&A tool into a continuous collaborator. The AI can reference past conversations or decisions accurately, making interactions more coherent over long projects. It also moves towards the concept of an agent that can maintain a plan/context beyond a single prompt-response cycle. For the engineering team, this means adding a memory retrieval step (similar to RAG retrieval) in the pipeline and designing how memory entries are created (e.g., after each response, store a summary).
Real-Time Streaming and Collaboration
Real-time feedback is crucial for a smooth developer experience, so our extended design emphasizes streaming and collaborative capabilities:
Streaming Token Responses: Both the Azure OpenAI and Google Gemini APIs support streaming of tokens as the model generates text. Our .NET backend will utilize these features so that as soon as the AI starts formulating an answer or code snippet, the frontend can render it incrementally. This is achieved via server-sent events (SSE) or WebSockets between the backend and Next.js frontend. The user will see answers ‚Äútyping out‚Äù live, similar to how ChatGPT or other coding assistants stream their output. Streaming improves interactivity and allows the user to interrupt or refine queries early if needed.
Intermediate Thought Visibility: In future, especially with advanced models like Gemini or agentic setups, we might stream not only the final answer but also intermediate steps or the agent‚Äôs reasoning (when appropriate). For example, if the AI is performing a multi-step tool use (searching for a file, then generating code), the frontend could show a trace of actions (though carefully, to not overwhelm or confuse the user).
Multi-User Collaboration (Future Concept): The term ‚Äúcowork space‚Äù suggests the possibility of multiple collaborators. We envision a scenario where multiple developers and the AI assistant share a session, possibly each on their own machines, but connected to the same AI agent. This could allow something like a collaborative chat or even a collaborative editor where the AI and humans are jointly editing a code file or discussing in one channel. While full multi-user editing is complex and out of scope for the initial implementation, our architecture can lay the groundwork:
Sessions in the backend identified by a session ID or room ID.
If two users join the same session, they both see the chat context and streaming responses.
The AI could take input from either user and respond, and all parties see it.
This could be useful for pair programming with an AI, or even code review meetings where the AI is a participant.
Live Code Previews: As part of real-time interaction, the frontend might show live previews of code diffs or rendered markdown. For instance, if the AI proposes a code change, the UI can show a diff view in real-time as the diff is being generated. This tight feedback loop makes it easier to evaluate the AI‚Äôs suggestions on the fly.
Performance Considerations: Real-time streaming and collaboration require efficient state management. The backend must handle open streaming connections and possibly broadcast to multiple clients. We will likely use async streaming patterns in .NET (e.g., asynchronous iterators or SignalR/WebSocket hubs for multi-client scenarios). Ensuring low latency from LLM APIs is also important ‚Äì which might mean we need to tune model parameters for speed (e.g., maybe use top_p/top_k settings to get faster, albeit maybe less deterministic, responses for certain quick interactions).
By focusing on real-time features, we ensure the AI coworker is responsive and engaging. The developer should feel the assistant is working with them in the moment, not delivering delayed monologues. Collaboration features hint at a future where an entire team could brainstorm with the AI in a shared space, making the development process more interactive and collective.
Developer Productivity Use Cases
Bringing together all the above enhancements, here are some scenarios illustrating how developers can leverage the extended RAG cowork space:
1. Project Bootstrapping: A developer can start a brand new project by describing the requirements to the AI. For example: ‚ÄúI need a simple REST API in .NET for a task management app, with JWT auth and a SQLite database.‚Äù The AI (using an LLM and possibly retrieving snippets from known templates in Qdrant) will propose a project structure (folders, key files like Program.cs, appsettings.json, etc.). It might create multiple files with boilerplate code. Using the Gemini model here allows it to output a lot of initial code in one go. The developer can then iterate file by file with the AI to adjust details. This showcases multi-file generation and streaming ‚Äì the developer sees files being suggested in real-time.
2. Context-Aware Code Modification: Suppose the project is in progress and the developer wants to refactor a function that is used in many places. They can say: ‚ÄúOptimize the CalculateTax function in FinanceUtils.js and update all its usages across the repo.‚Äù The system will fetch FinanceUtils.js content and identify where CalculateTax is called in other files (using the index). The AI (likely GPT-4 or Gemini) then returns a multi-part answer: an improved version of the function and a list of changes or diffs for each usage (maybe some call sites need an extra parameter now, etc.). The answer is backed by actual repo data, so it knows all usage points. The developer can review these changes, and with GitHub integration, even commit them directly.
3. Debugging with Complete Context: If a test is failing or an error is thrown, the developer can ask the AI to help debug: ‚ÄúWe have a null pointer exception when saving an order. What‚Äôs the cause?‚Äù The AI can use the error message and trace to search the codebase (via embeddings) for relevant code. With Gemini‚Äôs large context, it might even take the entire log or stack trace (which can be long) plus relevant code files in one prompt. The AI could find that, say, an order item was not initialized in a certain method and point to the exact line. It could then suggest a code fix. This shows how having lots of context (the entire stack trace, multiple files) in one go can pinpoint issues.
4. Documentation and Explanation: A new team member could use the cowork space to understand the project. They might ask high-level questions like ‚ÄúHow is authentication handled in this repo?‚Äù The system would retrieve the relevant parts (maybe the AuthService.cs, configuration files, etc.) and the LLM will summarize: ‚ÄúAuthentication is implemented via JWT. There is an AuthService class responsible for XYZ...‚Äù citing the files. Because the AI has seen all the code, it can explain features accurately. If something is unclear, the user can drill down, and the AI can open the specific file or function. This use case highlights the knowledge management aspect ‚Äì the AI as an encyclopedia of the project.
5. GitOps and Code Reviews: With deeper Git integration, a developer can ask: ‚ÄúAI, review my latest commit and suggest improvements.‚Äù The system can fetch the diff from the last commit on GitHub, and have the LLM critique it or suggest better approaches. Alternatively: ‚ÄúOpen a PR for adding feature X‚Äù ‚Äì the AI could prepare the branch and PR description. In a code review meeting scenario, as mentioned earlier, the AI could even be invoked by multiple team members to discuss code changes live.
6. Multi-Modal Future (Design + Code): Because Gemini is multimodal, imagine a future case: the developer drags a screenshot of an error stacktrace or a UML diagram of a new feature into the chat. Gemini can parse the image (OCR or diagram understanding) and incorporate that into its response. E.g., the UML diagram could be translated into a skeleton of code. While not the first priority, the architecture is prepared for such multi-modal inputs given Gemini‚Äôs capabilities (the prompt interface would attach an image or other media and the model can handle it).
Each of these scenarios demonstrates how the extended features work together to create a powerful developer assistant:
The multi-LLM routing ensures the right model is used for the job (fast turnaround vs huge context).
The RAG pipeline and memory provide grounding and continuity, so answers and code are relevant to the actual project.
GitHub integration means the AI‚Äôs suggestions are actionable in the codebase, reducing the gap between advice and implementation.
Real-time streaming and collaboration make the experience interactive and engaging, fitting naturally into a developer‚Äôs workflow (just like coding with a colleague).
Architectural Summary and Future Directions
In summary, the extended architecture of the RAG cowork space can be visualized as follows:
Frontend (Next.js): Presents a chat/code interface with model selection, streaming response viewer, and perhaps a file explorer view of the repo. It sends user prompts and any attached data (files, images) to the backend, and displays responses or diffs. Could include a collaborative mode UI in the future.
Backend (Azure OpenAI .NET Service): Coordinates all operations:
LLM Router & Adapters: Routes requests to Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, or Google Gemini APIs. Each adapter handles the specifics of calling that LLM. This layer makes adding new models straightforward.
RAG Context Manager: Orchestrates retrieving relevant context from Qdrant (and possibly summaries from memory). It uses enhanced chunking and intelligent selection to build the prompt. If a GitHub repository is connected, this manager can also fetch on-demand file content or trigger re-indexing.
GitHub Integration Module: Handles connecting to GitHub API or local git operations. Responsible for repository indexing, and also for performing any write-back operations (like creating a commit or PR) if that feature is enabled.
Memory Store: Manages long-term memory entries for conversations and user preferences. Tightly integrated with the context manager to supply conversational context when needed.
Streaming & Session Handler: Manages streaming responses to the frontend and synchronizing session state. Potentially manages multi-user sessions using a pub-sub mechanism for collaborative scenarios.
Vector Database (Qdrant): Serves as the knowledge base for both code and docs. Stores embeddings for code chunks, documentation, and possibly conversation memory. Facilitates semantic search to fetch relevant information given a query.
External Services:
Azure OpenAI service (if used) for GPT-4, etc.
OpenAI API (if used for other models).
Google Vertex AI for Gemini 2.5 Pro.
GitHub API for repository data and actions.
(Possibly other tools in future, e.g., a test runner service if we integrate code execution).
All components work in concert to deliver on the vision of an AI coworker. Gemini 2.5 Pro integration is a highlight, granting the system unprecedented access to large context and multimodal understanding within this architecture. The combination of RAG and huge context means the assistant can literally incorporate an entire codebase into its "brain" when formulating answers ‚Äì something that was impractical with smaller context windows. Finally, looking forward, the end-goal for the product is to become a holistic AI development assistant that doesn‚Äôt just answer questions but actively participates in software development. This means not only writing code, but understanding project goals, tracking tasks, testing code, and learning from the team. The architecture we‚Äôve laid out is a big step in that direction. It sets up the foundation for an AI pair-programmer that is:
Knowledgeable (about your code, docs, and beyond),
Context-aware (remembers discussions and understands where changes fit in the big picture),
Flexible (able to use the best AI model for the task, and even tools like Git or search when needed),
Interactive (works with you in real-time, even with multiple people),
Trustworthy (grounded responses with sources, and only acting with user‚Äôs permission on code changes).
With these extensions, our RAG cowork space project is not just a Q&A chatbot, but evolving into an AI teammate for developers. This document serves as a blueprint for engineers to implement and collaborate on these features, ensuring we share a clear vision and a structured path to the North Star product we aspire to build.

ChatGPT said:
The .NET backend in your RAG Workspace monorepo serves as the core orchestration layer that handles all AI-related operations‚Äîchat completion, RAG retrieval, vector embedding, and multi-LLM switching. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works and what each component does:

‚úÖ Tech Stack
Framework: ASP.NET Core 8 Web API

Language: C#

Containerized: via Dockerfile and docker-compose

API Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/api/chat

üß† Primary Responsibilities
The backend acts as the intelligence engine and orchestrator. It:

Accepts user chat input from the frontend.

Retrieves relevant context from Qdrant using semantic search.

Generates embeddings (Azure/OpenAI text-embedding-3-large or others).

Calls an LLM (e.g. Azure GPT-4, Gemini, or Llama 3 via Ollama) using a flexible provider pattern.

Streams or returns a reply to the frontend.

üí¨ Chat Flow Example
csharp
Copy
Edit
// Controllers/ChatController.cs
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> Post([FromBody] MessageDto dto)
{
    var reply = await _chat.GetChatCompletionAsync(dto);
    return Ok(reply);
}
The flow:
Accepts JSON MessageDto from the frontend.

Calls ChatService.GetChatCompletionAsync(), which:

Embeds the query

Retrieves top-k similar chunks from Qdrant

Constructs a RAG prompt

Passes it to the appropriate LLM via AgentOrchestrator

Returns the assistant reply

ü§ñ Multi-LLM Model Switching
Uses a IChatModel interface (strategy pattern).

Models supported:

Azure OpenAI (gpt-4o, gpt-35-turbo)

OpenAI (gpt-4, gpt-3.5)

Gemini (gemini-2.5-pro)

Local Ollama (llama3, via gRPC)

Switch logic:

csharp
Copy
Edit
// AgentOrchestrator.cs
var model = request.Headers["X-Model"]; // e.g. "gemini-2.5"
var provider = _providerFactory.GetModel(model);
var reply = await provider.GenerateAsync(context, message);
üîç Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Uses EmbeddingService to turn queries/files into vectors

Stores and queries chunks from Qdrant

RetrievalService handles similarity search and context filtering

Retrieved chunks get injected into the LLM prompt before generation

üß© Integration with Frontend
The frontend (Next.js) uses an Axios client in lib/api.ts to hit:

ts
Copy
Edit
POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat
Headers: { "X-Model": "gpt-4o" }
Body:    { messages: [...] }
üê≥ Containerized Deployment

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "RagWorkspace.Api.dll", "--urls", "http://0.0.0.0:8080"]
üõ†Ô∏è Extensibility
You can easily extend the backend by:

Adding GitHub repo parsing logic in AgentOrchestrator.cs

Integrating Semantic Kernel or Microsoft Agent SDK

Supporting auth/token-based user sessions

Swapping out vector DB (e.g. PostgreSQL + pgvector)

where files get stored
ChatGPT said:
In your .NET backend, files are not permanently stored by default‚Äîbut here's how and where files or data can be stored or streamed depending on the context and purpose:

üîç 1. Vectorized File Chunks (for RAG)
Where:

Stored inside Qdrant (vector database)

Each file is chunked (split into pieces), embedded (turned into a vector), and saved with metadata like file_path, repo, or chunk_index.

Code Location:

EmbeddingService.cs: generates embeddings

RetrievalService.cs: stores/retrieves in Qdrant via HTTP or gRPC

Data Flow:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
üìÑ File (e.g. `auth.py`)
  ‚Üí chunked & embedded
    ‚Üí stored in Qdrant vector DB
üì¶ 2. Temp File Uploads (Optional Extension)
If you allow file uploads (e.g., .zip of a repo, or a .md spec doc):

Where to store:

Temporarily: Path.GetTempPath() or a uploads/ directory in the container.

Persistent volume: Mount a shared volume in Docker (e.g., /mnt/data) if you want to persist between runs.

Code (not yet present):
You‚Äôd need a controller like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[HttpPost("upload")]
public async Task<IActionResult> UploadFile(IFormFile file)
{
    var tempPath = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), file.FileName);
    using var stream = new FileStream(tempPath, FileMode.Create);
    await file.CopyToAsync(stream);
    // ... chunk & embed here
    return Ok();
}
üß† 3. Memory Store (Future / Optional)
For persistent memory of conversations or user preferences:

Where:

Store memory entries in Qdrant (tagged as memory)

Or, store JSON summaries in a lightweight file-based DB like LiteDB, SQLite, or CosmosDB (cloud)

üìÇ 4. Cloned GitHub Repositories (If Git Integration is Enabled)
Where:

Cloned into a workspace/ directory inside the backend container or mounted Docker volume.

Example: /app/repos/my-project/

Use Case:

Index files, read them into memory, embed, delete after use or periodically clean.

Docker Volume Example (for persistence):

yaml
Copy
Edit
services:
  backend:
    volumes:
      - ./repos:/app/repos
üí° Summary
Purpose	Storage Location	Persistence
RAG vectorized chunks	Qdrant (in-memory or disk-backed)	Yes
Uploaded files	/tmp, /uploads, or /mnt/data	Optional
GitHub repo clones	/app/repos/...	Yes (via volume)
Memory (chat summaries)	Qdrant index or lightweight DB	Optional (configurable)

Would you like to add a FileUploadController and storage path to your current backend to support .zip or .md uploads next?

You said:
imagine its a product website called like project-rag.com i own that domain 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect‚Äîif you're envisioning this as a polished developer-focused product site at project-rag.com, here's how to shape the backend file architecture, usage strategy, and public perception to reflect a real-world SaaS-grade AI platform:

üß≠ Product Vision
Project RAG (project-rag.com) is a developer AI assistant that clones your repo, reads every file, and lets you chat with your codebase. It uses multi-model LLMs (like Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Llama 3) to generate code, reason across large files, and automate pull requests‚Äîpowered by vector search and retrieval-augmented generation.

üìÅ File Management (SaaS Perspective)
1. Where Files Are Stored (Product-Wide View)
Type	Storage Path	Notes
üîå GitHub Repos (Cloned)	/mnt/repos/{org}/{repo}/	Mounted volume or Azure File share (for indexing only)
üìé Uploaded Files	/mnt/uploads/{user_id}/	E.g., markdown spec docs, zipped repos
üîë Vector Embeddings	Qdrant (repo_id:chunk_hash)	Metadata: repo, file_path, chunk, timestamp
üß† Memory & Notes	Qdrant or SQLite per user	Stored as conversation vectors or structured JSON
üöÄ Temp Workflows	/mnt/tmp/	Used for processing zip files or diffs on demand

You can enforce lifecycle rules: auto-delete after X days or post-indexing.

üõ†Ô∏è File System Strategy in Code
In your backend container (rag-backend), you'd map:

yaml
Copy
Edit
volumes:
  uploads_volume:
  repos_volume:

services:
  backend:
    volumes:
      - uploads_volume:/mnt/uploads
      - repos_volume:/mnt/repos
So file-aware logic can work like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
string uploadPath = $"/mnt/uploads/{userId}/{file.FileName}";
string repoPath = $"/mnt/repos/{org}/{repo}/";
üîê Privacy & Access
Repos are never executed, only read and parsed for embeddings.

No external calls during indexing except to fetch from GitHub or embed.

All file storage is scoped to a secure tenant path (e.g., by user ID, org ID).

Optional: offer enterprise customers S3/GCS/Azure Blob storage binding.

üåê How This Appears on project-rag.com
For End Users:
‚ÄúDrop your repo or upload a zipped folder ‚Äî we‚Äôll index and let you chat with it instantly.‚Äù

‚ÄúProject RAG never executes your code. Files are stored securely and used only to extract context.‚Äù

‚ÄúBacked by vector DB tech and encrypted multi-LLM querying.‚Äù

Landing Page Examples:
project-rag.com/onboarding: Upload or connect GitHub

project-rag.com/chat: Start talking to your codebase

project-rag.com/docs/privacy: How we store and handle files

project-rag.com/workspaces: View all uploaded/linked repos and status

‚úÖ Suggestion: Add a FileController for Upload
If you want users to upload .zip or .md files:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[HttpPost("upload")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Upload(IFormFile file)
{
    var userId = HttpContext.User.Identity.Name ?? "guest";
    var uploadsPath = Path.Combine("/mnt/uploads", userId);
    Directory.CreateDirectory(uploadsPath);
    
    var filePath = Path.Combine(uploadsPath, file.FileName);
    using var fs = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Create);
    await file.CopyToAsync(fs);

    // Trigger chunking + embedding
    await _embeddingService.IndexFileAsync(filePath);
    return Ok(new { status = "indexed" });
}
Would you like me to draft a full project-rag.com landing page + file upload handler + onboarding UX?

how does azure file share work
ChatGPT said:
Azure File Share is a cloud-based network file system that lets you mount a persistent, shared storage drive (like a regular SMB file share or NFS mount) to your apps‚Äîeven inside containers or virtual machines. It's ideal for projects like project-rag.com where you want to store uploaded files, cloned repos, embeddings, or shared logs outside your container lifecycle.

üß† TL;DR: What Is Azure File Share?
It‚Äôs like a shared network drive that lives in the cloud:

üìÇ Works like a folder: you can read/write/delete files.

üîÅ Accessible from Windows, Linux, or containers (via SMB or NFS).

üì¶ Persistent: data survives container restarts, crashes, or scale events.

üîê Secure: supports SAS tokens, Azure AD, or private endpoints.

üß± Key Components
Concept	What it Means
Storage Account	The container for all Azure storage (blobs, files, etc.)
File Share	A named folder inside the storage account (e.g., repos/)
Mount Path	Where your app accesses the share (e.g., /mnt/repos)

üõ†Ô∏è Example Setup for project-rag.com
You can set up one or more file shares like:

Use Case	File Share Name	Mount Path in Backend
Uploaded Files	uploads	/mnt/uploads
GitHub Repos	repos	/mnt/repos
Logs	logs	/mnt/logs

üöÄ How to Use in a Dockerized .NET App (Azure Container Apps or AKS)
Step 1: Create File Share
In Azure Portal:

Go to your Storage Account

Click on File shares

Click + File share, name it (e.g. uploads)

Step 2: Mount to Container App
In Azure Container Apps or Web App for Containers, under Volumes:

Create a volume:

Type: Azure File Share

Storage account: your storage

File share name: uploads

Mount path: /mnt/uploads

The container can now access files under /mnt/uploads like a normal folder.

Step 3: Use in Code
Your backend service (C#/.NET) just writes to a path like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
var path = "/mnt/uploads/" + userId + "/" + file.FileName;
using var fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Create);
await file.CopyToAsync(fs);
You don't need to install anything extra ‚Äî it's mounted at the OS level.

üìà Advantages for project-rag.com
Benefit	Why It Matters
Persistence	Uploaded repos don‚Äôt disappear after restart
Scaling	Shared storage works across replicas
Compliance	You can encrypt, back up, or audit
Flexibility	Can be used by web, worker, and API apps simultaneously

‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations
Latency: Slower than local disk; fine for file reads/writes, not ideal for high-frequency temp data.

Permissions: Use SAS token, managed identity, or shared key access.

Cost: Charged per used GB + operations (read/write/list).

Would you like a docker-compose.override.yml or Azure Bicep template to mount Azure File Shares into your backend container automatically?

You said:
do research on how ot use azure file share services in this repo 
ChatGPT said:
To tailor the research accurately, could you clarify a few things:

Will the Azure File Share be used in local dev (via docker-compose) or only in Azure deployments (e.g., Container Apps, Web App, AKS)?

Do you want to mount the share directly into the backend container (e.g., /mnt/uploads)?

Is the goal to support file uploads from users (e.g., zipped repos or markdown) or backend-only file reads/writes?

This will help me focus the research on integration examples, SDKs, or mounting strategies that fit your project‚Äôs architecture.

Using Azure File Share Services in RAG Workspace Repo

Integrating Azure File Share into a .NET RAG Backend
Building a GitHub-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform (e.g. for project-rag.com) requires a robust way to store and access user-provided data like code repositories and documents. Azure File Share is a good solution for persistent, shared storage accessible from both local development and cloud deployments. Below, we cover how to configure Azure File Share in a .NET backend, including mounting in various environments, using environment variables for configuration, uploading and processing files (like zipped GitHub repos or Markdown docs), and best practices for security and scaling.
Configuration with Environment Variables (.env)
Use environment variables for all Azure File Share settings ‚Äì never hard-code secrets. In your local development, you can store these in a .env file, and in Azure you can use App Settings or Key Vault references. Typical variables include the Azure Storage connection string, the file share name, and the desired mount path. For example, your .env might contain:
bash
Copy
Edit
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=...;AccountName=<ACCOUNT>;AccountKey=<KEY>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
AZURE_FILE_SHARE_NAME="uploads"
MOUNT_PATH="/mnt/uploads"
In .NET (C#), you can read these values at runtime and initialize the Azure Files client. For instance:
csharp
Copy
Edit
string connection = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING");
string shareName = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_FILE_SHARE_NAME");
// Initialize a ShareClient to interact with the Azure file share
ShareClient share = new ShareClient(connection, shareName);
This uses the Azure.Storage.Files.Shares library to connect to the file share using the connection string and share name from configuration
linkedin.com
linkedin.com
. Storing the connection string in an environment variable or configuration file (and not in code) is a best practice
linkedin.com
. The MOUNT_PATH (e.g. /mnt/uploads) will be used when mounting the share as a volume (explained below), so your application can treat it as a local directory.
Security Tip: Use Azure Key Vault to store secrets like the storage account key, and reference them in your app settings (Azure App Service and Container Apps support Key Vault references). This avoids exposing the raw connection string. At minimum, ensure your .env is not committed to source control and that you rotate/regenerate keys periodically (using the secondary key to avoid downtime)
learn.microsoft.com
.
Local Development: Mounting with Docker Compose
During local development, you can mount the Azure File Share into your Docker container so that your app can read/write files as if it were a local path. Docker Compose allows mounting an Azure file share via SMB (CIFS). One approach is to use a volume with the local driver and driver_opts for CIFS. Ensure you have the storage account name and key handy (from Azure Portal > Storage Account > Access keys). For example, in your docker-compose.yml:
yaml
Copy
Edit
services:
  app:
    image: your-app-image:latest
    volumes:
      - azurefiles:/mnt/uploads  # mount volume to /mnt/uploads in container

volumes:
  azurefiles:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: cifs
      o: "mfsymlinks,vers=3.0,username=${STORAGE_ACCOUNT},password=${STORAGE_KEY},addr=${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}.file.core.windows.net"
      device: "//${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}.file.core.windows.net/${SHARE_NAME}"
srcecde.me
 In the above Compose file, we define a volume named azurefiles that uses the CIFS file system (type: cifs) to mount the Azure file share. The device is the UNC path to the share (//<account>.file.core.windows.net/<share>), and we pass the storage account name and key as options (these come from environment variables in the .env file, e.g. STORAGE_ACCOUNT, STORAGE_KEY, SHARE_NAME). The container service then mounts this volume to the path /mnt/uploads. After configuring the .env with the correct values
srcecde.me
, you can run docker-compose up and Docker will mount the Azure share into the container. Important: Azure Files mounts over SMB work only on Linux containers, and the container must run as root to mount the share
stackoverflow.com
. If your Docker image uses a non-root user, you may need to adjust it (e.g. add user: root in the compose file for that service). Also, Azure file shares are mounted as whole; you cannot mount a specific subfolder ‚Äì the entire share is mapped into the container path
stackoverflow.com
. Any changes to files in the share (via Azure portal or other processes) will reflect in the mounted volume in real time. Keep in mind that port 445 (SMB) must be accessible from your dev machine (which it is by default for outbound Azure access). If you prefer not to mount the live Azure share during development, an alternative is to use local storage or a simulated share path. For example, you could mount a local host directory to /mnt/uploads for dev/test. However, using the actual Azure File Share in dev ensures you catch any permission or path issues early and that your code works the same against Azure Files APIs.
Azure App Service: Configuring Azure File Share Mounts
When deploying to Azure App Service (especially Linux containers or Web Apps on Linux), you can configure an Azure File Share to mount into your app's file system. Azure App Service provides a Path Mappings (for Web Apps) or storage mounting feature that uses the storage account credentials. In the Azure Portal, for a Web App (Linux), go to Configuration > Path settings and click New Azure Storage Mount. You will need to provide: a name (alias) for the mount, the storage account and file share names, and the access key, plus the mount path (e.g. /mnt/uploads). Once applied, the App Service will mount the share to that path inside the container. Alternatively, you can automate this with Azure CLI. For example:
bash
Copy
Edit
az webapp config storage-account add --resource-group <YOUR_RG> \
  --name <YOUR_APP_NAME> \
  --custom-id azurefiles1 \
  --storage-type AzureFiles \
  --account-name <STORAGE_ACCOUNT> \
  --share-name <SHARE_NAME> \
  --access-key "<ACCESS_KEY>" \
  --mount-path /mnt/uploads
learn.microsoft.com
 This command tells the App Service to mount the given storage account's file share at /mnt/uploads in the app's file system. (On Windows App Service, you would use a drive letter like D:\mount\path for the mount path, but on Linux it's a POSIX path
learn.microsoft.com
.) After running this, you can verify the mount via az webapp config storage-account list or in the Portal (it will show up under Path Mappings)
learn.microsoft.com
. Now your .NET application running on App Service can simply read/write files under /mnt/uploads as if they were local. For example, writing to /mnt/uploads/user123/myrepo.zip will actually store the file in the Azure File Share. Make sure the app‚Äôs environment variables (App Settings) include the same connection info if your code also uses the Azure SDK (though if you rely purely on the mounted path, the SDK calls may not be necessary ‚Äì you could use System.IO file calls instead). Note: The App Service platform will take care of mounting on each instance. If your app scales to multiple instances, all will connect to the same share. Ensure the storage account‚Äôs performance can handle concurrent access (see Best Practices below)
learn.microsoft.com
. Also, avoid regenerating the storage key without updating the App Service config, as that would break the mount
learn.microsoft.com

Azure Container Apps also support Azure File Share mounts. The process involves two steps: (1) Link the Azure Storage File Share to your Container Apps Environment, and (2) mount the share in your container app definition. First, use the Azure CLI to add the storage to the environment:
bash
Copy
Edit
az containerapp env storage set --resource-group <YOUR_RG> \
  --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
  --storage-name <STORAGE_ALIAS> \
  --azure-file-account-name <STORAGE_ACCOUNT> \
  --azure-file-account-key <STORAGE_KEY> \
  --azure-file-share-name <SHARE_NAME> \
  --access-mode ReadWrite
learn.microsoft.com
 This registers the file share (identified by storage account, key, and share name) with the Container Apps environment, under a alias (e.g. "mystorage"). Next, you need to configure your Container App to use this storage. If using Bicep/ARM or the CLI YAML approach, you would add a volume and volume mount. For example, in the container app's template, define a volume referencing the storage:
yaml
Copy
Edit
volumes:
  - name: azure-files-volume
    storageType: AzureFile
    storageName: mystorage    # must match the alias set in the environment
Then mount it in the container by specifying a volumeMounts entry:
yaml
Copy
Edit
containers:
- name: myapp
  image: your-app-image
  volumeMounts:
    - volumeName: azure-files-volume
      mountPath: /mnt/uploads
      # (optional) subPath: "some/subfolder" 
In this example, we gave the volume name "azure-files-volume" and mount it at /mnt/uploads inside the container
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
. The storageName: mystorage links that volume to the Azure File Share we set in the environment. After deploying this configuration (via az containerapp update --yaml ... or through Bicep/ARM templates), the Container App will automatically mount the file share. Like App Service, all replicas of your container app will share this same mounted volume. You can then use normal file I/O or Azure SDK in your .NET code to access /mnt/uploads. Notes for Container Apps:
Ensure your Container App environment is in the same VNet or region that can access the storage account (if using private endpoints or firewall, configure accordingly). By default, Azure Files is accessible over the internet with the access key.
Container Apps support both SMB (AzureFile) and NFS mounts. SMB (AzureFile) is suitable for Windows or Linux containers; NFS requires a custom VNet and NFS-enabled storage account
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
. In most cases, SMB (the default AzureFile) is what you need.
There is a subPath option (as shown above) which allows mounting a specific sub-directory of the share to a specific path in the container. However, note that the entire share is still mounted; subPath just controls the container's view (this can be useful to isolate per-app data if multiple volumes use the same share).
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Using Azure Files as a Persistent Volume
If deploying on AKS, Azure File Share can be used as a PersistentVolume that is mounted into your pods. Azure Files supports concurrent ReadWriteMany access, which means multiple pods can share the volume ‚Äì ideal for a scaled-out app needing shared data
learn.microsoft.com
. The typical setup is to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that uses the Azure Files CSI driver. You can either dynamically provision or statically specify the file share. For example, a PVC manifest might look like:
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-azurefile-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: azurefile            # Azure Files storage class
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Gi
After applying this (and assuming the azurefile storage class is configured in the cluster), Kubernetes will create an Azure File Share behind the scenes (or bind to an existing one). Then, you mount it in your Pod or Deployment spec:
yaml
Copy
Edit
containers:
- name: app
  image: your-app-image
  volumeMounts:
    - name: filevol
      mountPath: /mnt/uploads
      readOnly: false
...
volumes:
- name: filevol
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: my-azurefile-pvc
learn.microsoft.com
 This will ensure that when the pod runs, the Azure file share is mounted at /mnt/uploads inside the container. Your .NET application can use that path transparently. The azurefile storage class uses the storage account key (managed via Kubernetes secret) to mount the share. As with other environments, you should pass the storage details via K8s secrets or use a CSI driver secret; Kubernetes will handle the mount process. Notes for AKS:
Make sure to install the Azure File CSI driver (it‚Äôs often installed by default in recent AKS versions). The CSI driver will create a Kubernetes Secret with the storage creds automatically when using dynamic provisioning
learn.microsoft.com
.
If you want to use a specific existing file share, you can create a Secret for the account name/key and a PersistentVolume manifest pointing to that share (then a PVC to claim it)
medium.com
, but using dynamic PVC is simpler.
As with other cases, all pods that mount the same PVC share data. Coordinate writes if necessary and be mindful of file locking if multiple instances write the same files.
Handling File Uploads to Azure File Share
Once the Azure File Share is mounted or accessible, your .NET backend can accept file uploads (e.g. a user uploading a ZIP of a GitHub repository or a Markdown file) and store them on the share. You can either write to the mounted path using System.IO, or use the Azure SDK to upload to the share. For example, suppose you have an API endpoint that receives a file (as a stream) and you want to save it under /mnt/uploads/{userId}/{filename} on the share. If the share is mounted to /mnt/uploads, you could do something as simple as:
csharp
Copy
Edit
string userId = /* the user's ID */;
string uploadsPath = Path.Combine("/mnt/uploads", userId);
Directory.CreateDirectory(uploadsPath); // ensure user folder exists
string filePath = Path.Combine(uploadsPath, fileName);
using (var fileStream = File.Create(filePath))
{
    await uploadStream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
}
The above will directly write the uploaded content to the mounted share via the file system. If instead you prefer to use Azure SDK (which is useful if you haven't actually mounted the share and want to interact purely via API), you can do:
csharp
Copy
Edit
// Get a reference to the directory (folder) for the user, create if not exists
ShareDirectoryClient userDir = share.GetDirectoryClient(userId);
await userDir.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();

// Get a reference to the file on the share and upload the stream
ShareFileClient fileClient = userDir.GetFileClient(fileName);
await fileClient.CreateAsync(uploadStream.Length);
await fileClient.UploadAsync(uploadStream);
This uses ShareDirectoryClient and ShareFileClient from the Azure.Storage.Files.Shares SDK to ensure the directory exists and then create/upload the file in Azure Storage
linkedin.com
. The SDK approach works whether or not the share is physically mounted; it talks to Azure via REST. The file will end up in the same place ({share}/{userId}/{fileName}). Both methods achieve the same result ‚Äì choose based on convenience. In many cases, using the mounted path is simplest for read/write (just treat it like a local disk). For large files, the SDK might handle retries/chunking under the hood, but the code above (Create + Upload in one go) is effectively doing the same as a stream copy. After uploading, you‚Äôll likely want to provide feedback to the user (e.g., ‚ÄúUpload successful, now indexing repository...‚Äù). At this point, the file (e.g. a ZIP archive or document) is safely stored in Azure Files under the user‚Äôs directory. The next step is to process it (extract the contents, index them, etc.) in order to enable the RAG functionality.
Extracting and Syncing Repository Content (Claude-style Integration)
To emulate Claude‚Äôs GitHub integration, your application should automatically extract and index the uploaded repository or documents. Here‚Äôs how you can approach it:
Extract files from the archive: If the upload is a ZIP of a GitHub repo, you need to unzip it. You can do this in-memory or using a temp directory. For example, you might download the file from Azure Files (if not already on a local path) and then use System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive to extract it. For instance:
csharp
Copy
Edit
// Assume fileClient is a ShareFileClient for the uploaded ZIP
ShareFileDownloadInfo download = await fileClient.DownloadAsync();
using (var archive = new ZipArchive(download.Content, ZipArchiveMode.Read))
{
    foreach (var entry in archive.Entries)
    {
        string filePath = Path.Combine("/mnt/uploads", userId, entry.FullName);
        if (entry.Length == 0 && filePath.EndsWith(Path.DirectorySeparatorChar.ToString()))
        {
            // Directory entry
            Directory.CreateDirectory(filePath);
        }
        else
        {
            Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(filePath));
            entry.ExtractToFile(filePath, overwrite: true);
        }
    }
}
In this snippet, we download the ZIP from the share and then extract each entry to the mounted file share under the user's folder (recreating the repo directory structure). You could also extract to a temporary local folder (like Path.GetTempPath()) and then upload the extracted files back to Azure Files if you prefer (an approach used in some Azure Functions scenarios
linkedin.com
linkedin.com
). Extracting directly to the mounted path is convenient because it avoids an extra upload step ‚Äì the files end up on the share where they can be accessed by other processes or later inspection.
Index or embed the files: After extraction, you can iterate through the repository files and process them. For a RAG system, this typically means reading each file's contents and generating an embedding vector or indexing it in a search system. For example, you might have an AI embedding service (like Azure OpenAI or HuggingFace model) that converts text to vectors, and a vector database or Azure Cognitive Search index to store them. Pseudo-code:
csharp
Copy
Edit
foreach (string file in Directory.GetFiles($"/mnt/uploads/{userId}/{repoName}", "*.*", SearchOption.AllDirectories))
{
    string text = File.ReadAllText(file);
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(text)) continue;
    var embedding = EmbedText(text);  // call your embedding function or API
    SaveEmbedding(userId, repoName, file, embedding);
}
Here, SaveEmbedding would store the vector along with metadata like userId, repoName, and file path (so you know which file the content came from). You might store this in a database or directly in a vector index. The key is to track the file paths per user/repo along with the indexed content. This way, when the user asks a question, you can retrieve relevant files or passages by searching the embeddings, and you know exactly which file and repo they came from.
Maintain sync (optional): If you want ongoing sync like Claude (which can update when new commits are made), consider storing a reference to the repository (e.g., the GitHub repo URL or commit ID). In a Claude-like integration, you might connect via the GitHub API or webhooks:
Manual re-upload: The simplest approach is to require the user to upload a new ZIP when the repo updates. Your system then reprocesses it.
GitHub API: You could use a GitHub Personal Access Token to fetch repository contents directly (e.g., use the GitHub REST API to list files or download an archive). You can store the last indexed commit SHA. On a schedule or via webhook, check if a new commit exists and then fetch new files.
File comparison: If using the same Azure File Share path for the repo, you could periodically diff the content (though using GitHub API is more straightforward for actual git diffs).
To emulate Claude, implementing a webhook that triggers on push events is ideal. The webhook can call an endpoint in your app with the repo info, and then your app downloads the changed files (or whole repo zip) and updates the embeddings for just those files. This requires more complex integration, so you might start with on-demand uploads and add true syncing later.
Cleaning up and organizing: It‚Äôs a good idea to organize each upload by user and perhaps by repo or upload timestamp. For example, use a directory structure like /mnt/uploads/{userId}/{repoName}-{timestamp} for each upload to avoid collisions. If you extract files on the share, those will occupy space ‚Äì you might decide to keep them for caching (so you don't need to re-extract next time) or delete them after indexing to save space (since you can always re-extract from the ZIP if needed). Azure Files supports standard file operations, so you can delete or move files/directories as needed with File.Delete or Directory.Delete in .NET after processing.
By following these steps, your application will have for each user/repo: the raw uploaded archive (stored in Azure Files), the extracted repository files (either ephemeral or stored on Azure Files), and an index of embeddings or searchable text. When the user queries something, you search the index for that user‚Äôs repo content, find relevant files, and you could even retrieve the file snippets from Azure Files to feed into the final answer. This architecture closely mirrors Claude‚Äôs approach, where the repo is ingested and then queries are answered based on the indexed knowledge.
Security and Best Practices
Authentication & Access: Azure File Share access in our scenarios uses the storage account key (shared key). Protect this key. Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault rather than hardcoding
linkedin.com
. If possible, use a Shared Access Signature (SAS) with limited permissions instead of the full key ‚Äì for example, generate a SAS token that allows read/write on the specific file share and use that in your app. This limits the blast radius if the credentials leak. Azure Files also supports Azure AD authentication (with Azure AD DS or integration) for on-prem and some Azure scenarios, but using the storage key is the simplest for containerized apps. File Security: Validate and sanitize user uploads. If you allow arbitrary ZIPs, ensure you protect against zip-slip (the code above using ExtractToFile is careful to create directories and not write outside the target path). Consider scanning files for viruses or malicious code if your platform is public. Also enforce size limits to avoid extremely large uploads that could exhaust storage or make the app process too much data. Permissions: By default, the mounted share will allow read/write to any process in the container. Within the container, normal file system permissions apply. If running as root, all files will be owned by root. You might consider running as a less-privileged user and adjusting the CIFS mount options (e.g., uid, gid, file_mode, dir_mode) to control file ownership. For example, adding uid=1000,gid=1000,file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770 in the mount options string can make files accessible to a specific user/group in the container. This is especially relevant if multiple services share the same mount with different accounts. Scalability: Ensure the storage account and share are in the same region as your app to minimize latency
learn.microsoft.com
. Azure File Shares on standard tier have specific throughput and IOPS limits (e.g. up to ~60 MiB/s and 1000 IOPS for a single share by default, depending on size). If you expect heavy concurrent access (many users or large files), consider using Premium Azure Files which offers higher performance (with SSD-backed storage). You can switch to a premium FileStorage account which provides better IOPS and throughput, or enable large file share feature if you need more capacity. Monitor the share‚Äôs latency and throughput; if it becomes a bottleneck, you might partition data across multiple shares or storage accounts (for instance, one file share per user or per group of users) to distribute load. When your app scales out to multiple instances or pods, they all use the same share (which is great for consistency, but means all I/O funnels to one storage backend). Design your indexing jobs to handle this ‚Äì e.g., avoid all instances trying to process the same file simultaneously. It might be wise to have a single background worker role handle extraction/indexing tasks, to avoid race conditions. As the Azure docs note: if an app scales to many instances, choose the storage performance tier accordingly to avoid throughput bottlenecks
learn.microsoft.com
. Backup and Durability: Azure Files is highly durable (with triple replication by default). You can optionally enable Azure File Share snapshots/backup to capture versions of the file share data. This could be useful if users accidentally delete data or if you want point-in-time recovery of an uploaded dataset. Also, if your app allows deletion of repos, make sure to clean up the files from the share to save space (and possibly remove associated embeddings from your index to avoid stale data). Cleanup and Maintenance: Over time, users may upload many repos or large files. Implement a strategy to clean up old or unused data. For example, if a user disconnects a repo, you might remove its files after some grace period. Azure Files has a quota per share (you set this when creating the share). Keep an eye on usage; you can increase the quota or create additional shares as needed. Organizing data by user (and maybe by repo) as mentioned will help manage this. By integrating Azure File Share with your .NET backend in this way, you get a scalable, secure storage solution that works in development and production. You can mount the same share across environments to simplify testing. The result is a system where user data (code and docs) is centrally stored and easily accessible for your RAG pipeline ‚Äì empowering features like ‚ÄúChat with your code‚Äù or intelligent documentation search, much like Claude‚Äôs GitHub integration but custom-tailored to your project.

Thanks! I‚Äôll research how to integrate Azure File Share into your project-rag repo to support both local and cloud (Azure) deployments. I‚Äôll cover mounting strategies using `.env`, support for zipped and markdown file uploads, and GitHub-like sync flows similar to Claude‚Äôs project integration.

I‚Äôll follow up shortly with detailed guidance and code-ready examples.


# Integrating Azure File Share into a .NET RAG Backend

Building a GitHub-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform (e.g. for **project-rag.com**) requires a robust way to store and access user-provided data like code repositories and documents. Azure File Share is a good solution for persistent, shared storage accessible from both local development and cloud deployments. Below, we cover how to configure Azure File Share in a .NET backend, including mounting in various environments, using environment variables for configuration, uploading and processing files (like zipped GitHub repos or Markdown docs), and best practices for security and scaling.

## Configuration with Environment Variables (.env)

**Use environment variables for all Azure File Share settings** ‚Äì never hard-code secrets. In your local development, you can store these in a `.env` file, and in Azure you can use App Settings or Key Vault references. Typical variables include the Azure Storage connection string, the file share name, and the desired mount path. For example, your `.env` might contain:

```bash
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=...;AccountName=<ACCOUNT>;AccountKey=<KEY>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
AZURE_FILE_SHARE_NAME="uploads"
MOUNT_PATH="/mnt/uploads"
```

In .NET (C#), you can read these values at runtime and initialize the Azure Files client. For instance:

```csharp
string connection = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING");
string shareName = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_FILE_SHARE_NAME");
// Initialize a ShareClient to interact with the Azure file share
ShareClient share = new ShareClient(connection, shareName);
```

This uses the Azure.Storage.Files.Shares library to connect to the file share using the connection string and share name from configuration. Storing the connection string in an environment variable or configuration file (and *not* in code) is a best practice. The `MOUNT_PATH` (e.g. `/mnt/uploads`) will be used when mounting the share as a volume (explained below), so your application can treat it as a local directory.

> **Security Tip:** Use Azure Key Vault to store secrets like the storage account key, and reference them in your app settings (Azure App Service and Container Apps support Key Vault references). This avoids exposing the raw connection string. At minimum, ensure your `.env` is not committed to source control and that you rotate/regenerate keys periodically (using the secondary key to avoid downtime).

## Local Development: Mounting with Docker Compose

During local development, you can mount the Azure File Share into your Docker container so that your app can read/write files as if it were a local path. Docker Compose allows mounting an Azure file share via SMB (CIFS). One approach is to use a volume with the `local` driver and `driver_opts` for CIFS. Ensure you have the storage account name and key handy (from Azure Portal > Storage Account > Access keys). For example, in your **docker-compose.yml**:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: your-app-image:latest
    volumes:
      - azurefiles:/mnt/uploads  # mount volume to /mnt/uploads in container

volumes:
  azurefiles:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: cifs
      o: "mfsymlinks,vers=3.0,username=${STORAGE_ACCOUNT},password=${STORAGE_KEY},addr=${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}.file.core.windows.net"
      device: "//${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}.file.core.windows.net/${SHARE_NAME}"
```



In the above Compose file, we define a volume named **azurefiles** that uses the CIFS file system (`type: cifs`) to mount the Azure file share. The `device` is the UNC path to the share (`//<account>.file.core.windows.net/<share>`), and we pass the storage account name and key as options (these come from environment variables in the `.env` file, e.g. `STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, `STORAGE_KEY`, `SHARE_NAME`). The container service then mounts this volume to the path `/mnt/uploads`. After configuring the `.env` with the correct values, you can run `docker-compose up` and Docker will mount the Azure share into the container.

**Important:** Azure Files mounts over SMB work only on Linux containers, and the container must run as root to mount the share. If your Docker image uses a non-root user, you may need to adjust it (e.g. add `user: root` in the compose file for that service). Also, Azure file shares are mounted as whole; you cannot mount a specific subfolder ‚Äì the entire share is mapped into the container path. Any changes to files in the share (via Azure portal or other processes) will reflect in the mounted volume in real time. Keep in mind that port 445 (SMB) must be accessible from your dev machine (which it is by default for outbound Azure access).

*If you prefer not to mount the live Azure share during development*, an alternative is to use local storage or a simulated share path. For example, you could mount a local host directory to `/mnt/uploads` for dev/test. However, using the actual Azure File Share in dev ensures you catch any permission or path issues early and that your code works the same against Azure Files APIs.

## Azure App Service: Configuring Azure File Share Mounts

When deploying to Azure App Service (especially Linux containers or Web Apps on Linux), you can configure an Azure File Share to mount into your app's file system. Azure App Service provides a **Path Mappings** (for Web Apps) or storage mounting feature that uses the storage account credentials.

In the Azure Portal, for a Web App (Linux), go to **Configuration > Path settings** and click **New Azure Storage Mount**. You will need to provide: a name (alias) for the mount, the storage account and file share names, and the access key, plus the mount path (e.g. `/mnt/uploads`). Once applied, the App Service will mount the share to that path inside the container. Alternatively, you can automate this with Azure CLI. For example:

```bash
az webapp config storage-account add --resource-group <YOUR_RG> \
  --name <YOUR_APP_NAME> \
  --custom-id azurefiles1 \
  --storage-type AzureFiles \
  --account-name <STORAGE_ACCOUNT> \
  --share-name <SHARE_NAME> \
  --access-key "<ACCESS_KEY>" \
  --mount-path /mnt/uploads
```



This command tells the App Service to mount the given storage account's file share at `/mnt/uploads` in the app's file system. (On Windows App Service, you would use a drive letter like `D:\mount\path` for the mount path, but on Linux it's a POSIX path.) After running this, you can verify the mount via `az webapp config storage-account list` or in the Portal (it will show up under Path Mappings).

Now your .NET application running on App Service can simply read/write files under `/mnt/uploads` as if they were local. For example, writing to `/mnt/uploads/user123/myrepo.zip` will actually store the file in the Azure File Share. Make sure the app‚Äôs environment variables (App Settings) include the same connection info if your code also uses the Azure SDK (though if you rely purely on the mounted path, the SDK calls may not be necessary ‚Äì you could use System.IO file calls instead).

**Note:** The App Service platform will take care of mounting on each instance. If your app scales to multiple instances, all will connect to the same share. Ensure the storage account‚Äôs performance can handle concurrent access (see **Best Practices** below). Also, avoid regenerating the storage key without updating the App Service config, as that would break the mount.

## Azure Container Apps: Mounting Azure Files

Azure Container Apps also support Azure File Share mounts. The process involves two steps: (1) Link the Azure Storage File Share to your Container Apps Environment, and (2) mount the share in your container app definition.

First, use the Azure CLI to add the storage to the environment:

```bash
az containerapp env storage set --resource-group <YOUR_RG> \
  --name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> \
  --storage-name <STORAGE_ALIAS> \
  --azure-file-account-name <STORAGE_ACCOUNT> \
  --azure-file-account-key <STORAGE_KEY> \
  --azure-file-share-name <SHARE_NAME> \
  --access-mode ReadWrite
```



This registers the file share (identified by storage account, key, and share name) with the Container Apps environment, under a alias (e.g. "mystorage"). Next, you need to configure your Container App to use this storage. If using Bicep/ARM or the CLI YAML approach, you would add a volume and volume mount. For example, in the container app's template, define a volume referencing the storage:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: azure-files-volume
    storageType: AzureFile
    storageName: mystorage    # must match the alias set in the environment
```

Then mount it in the container by specifying a `volumeMounts` entry:

```yaml
containers:
- name: myapp
  image: your-app-image
  volumeMounts:
    - volumeName: azure-files-volume
      mountPath: /mnt/uploads
      # (optional) subPath: "some/subfolder" 
```

In this example, we gave the volume name "azure-files-volume" and mount it at `/mnt/uploads` inside the container. The `storageName: mystorage` links that volume to the Azure File Share we set in the environment. After deploying this configuration (via `az containerapp update --yaml ...` or through Bicep/ARM templates), the Container App will automatically mount the file share. Like App Service, all replicas of your container app will share this same mounted volume. You can then use normal file I/O or Azure SDK in your .NET code to access `/mnt/uploads`.

**Notes for Container Apps:**

* Ensure your Container App environment is in the same VNet or region that can access the storage account (if using private endpoints or firewall, configure accordingly). By default, Azure Files is accessible over the internet with the access key.
* Container Apps support both SMB (AzureFile) and NFS mounts. SMB (AzureFile) is suitable for Windows or Linux containers; NFS requires a custom VNet and NFS-enabled storage account. In most cases, SMB (the default AzureFile) is what you need.
* There is a **`subPath`** option (as shown above) which allows mounting a specific sub-directory of the share to a specific path in the container. However, note that the entire share is still mounted; `subPath` just controls the container's view (this can be useful to isolate per-app data if multiple volumes use the same share).

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Using Azure Files as a Persistent Volume

If deploying on AKS, Azure File Share can be used as a PersistentVolume that is mounted into your pods. Azure Files supports concurrent ReadWriteMany access, which means multiple pods can share the volume ‚Äì ideal for a scaled-out app needing shared data.

The typical setup is to create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that uses the Azure Files CSI driver. You can either dynamically provision or statically specify the file share. For example, a PVC manifest might look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-azurefile-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: azurefile            # Azure Files storage class
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Gi
```

After applying this (and assuming the `azurefile` storage class is configured in the cluster), Kubernetes will create an Azure File Share behind the scenes (or bind to an existing one). Then, you mount it in your Pod or Deployment spec:

```yaml
containers:
- name: app
  image: your-app-image
  volumeMounts:
    - name: filevol
      mountPath: /mnt/uploads
      readOnly: false
...
volumes:
- name: filevol
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: my-azurefile-pvc
```



This will ensure that when the pod runs, the Azure file share is mounted at `/mnt/uploads` inside the container. Your .NET application can use that path transparently. The `azurefile` storage class uses the storage account key (managed via Kubernetes secret) to mount the share. As with other environments, you should pass the storage details via K8s secrets or use a CSI driver secret; Kubernetes will handle the mount process.

**Notes for AKS:**

* Make sure to install the Azure File CSI driver (it‚Äôs often installed by default in recent AKS versions). The CSI driver will create a Kubernetes Secret with the storage creds automatically when using dynamic provisioning.
* If you want to use a specific existing file share, you can create a Secret for the account name/key and a PersistentVolume manifest pointing to that share (then a PVC to claim it), but using dynamic PVC is simpler.
* As with other cases, all pods that mount the same PVC share data. Coordinate writes if necessary and be mindful of file locking if multiple instances write the same files.

## Handling File Uploads to Azure File Share

Once the Azure File Share is mounted or accessible, your .NET backend can accept file uploads (e.g. a user uploading a ZIP of a GitHub repository or a Markdown file) and store them on the share. You can either write to the mounted path using System.IO, or use the Azure SDK to upload to the share.

For example, suppose you have an API endpoint that receives a file (as a stream) and you want to save it under `/mnt/uploads/{userId}/{filename}` on the share. If the share is mounted to `/mnt/uploads`, you could do something as simple as:

```csharp
string userId = /* the user's ID */;
string uploadsPath = Path.Combine("/mnt/uploads", userId);
Directory.CreateDirectory(uploadsPath); // ensure user folder exists
string filePath = Path.Combine(uploadsPath, fileName);
using (var fileStream = File.Create(filePath))
{
    await uploadStream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
}
```

The above will directly write the uploaded content to the mounted share via the file system. If instead you prefer to use Azure SDK (which is useful if you *haven't* actually mounted the share and want to interact purely via API), you can do:

```csharp
// Get a reference to the directory (folder) for the user, create if not exists
ShareDirectoryClient userDir = share.GetDirectoryClient(userId);
await userDir.CreateIfNotExistsAsync();

// Get a reference to the file on the share and upload the stream
ShareFileClient fileClient = userDir.GetFileClient(fileName);
await fileClient.CreateAsync(uploadStream.Length);
await fileClient.UploadAsync(uploadStream);
```

This uses `ShareDirectoryClient` and `ShareFileClient` from the Azure.Storage.Files.Shares SDK to ensure the directory exists and then create/upload the file in Azure Storage. The SDK approach works whether or not the share is physically mounted; it talks to Azure via REST. The file will end up in the same place (`{share}/{userId}/{fileName}`).

Both methods achieve the same result ‚Äì choose based on convenience. In many cases, using the mounted path is simplest for read/write (just treat it like a local disk). For large files, the SDK might handle retries/chunking under the hood, but the code above (Create + Upload in one go) is effectively doing the same as a stream copy.

After uploading, you‚Äôll likely want to provide feedback to the user (e.g., ‚ÄúUpload successful, now indexing repository...‚Äù). At this point, the file (e.g. a ZIP archive or document) is safely stored in Azure Files under the user‚Äôs directory. The next step is to process it (extract the contents, index them, etc.) in order to enable the RAG functionality.

## Extracting and Syncing Repository Content (Claude-style Integration)

To emulate Claude‚Äôs GitHub integration, your application should automatically extract and index the uploaded repository or documents. Here‚Äôs how you can approach it:

1. **Extract files from the archive:** If the upload is a ZIP of a GitHub repo, you need to unzip it. You can do this in-memory or using a temp directory. For example, you might download the file from Azure Files (if not already on a local path) and then use `System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive` to extract it. For instance:

   ```csharp
   // Assume fileClient is a ShareFileClient for the uploaded ZIP
   ShareFileDownloadInfo download = await fileClient.DownloadAsync();
   using (var archive = new ZipArchive(download.Content, ZipArchiveMode.Read))
   {
       foreach (var entry in archive.Entries)
       {
           string filePath = Path.Combine("/mnt/uploads", userId, entry.FullName);
           if (entry.Length == 0 && filePath.EndsWith(Path.DirectorySeparatorChar.ToString()))
           {
               // Directory entry
               Directory.CreateDirectory(filePath);
           }
           else
           {
               Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(filePath));
               entry.ExtractToFile(filePath, overwrite: true);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   In this snippet, we download the ZIP from the share and then extract each entry to the mounted file share under the user's folder (recreating the repo directory structure). You could also extract to a temporary local folder (like `Path.GetTempPath()`) and then upload the extracted files back to Azure Files if you prefer (an approach used in some Azure Functions scenarios). Extracting directly to the mounted path is convenient because it avoids an extra upload step ‚Äì the files end up on the share where they can be accessed by other processes or later inspection.

2. **Index or embed the files:** After extraction, you can iterate through the repository files and process them. For a RAG system, this typically means reading each file's contents and generating an embedding vector or indexing it in a search system. For example, you might have an AI embedding service (like Azure OpenAI or HuggingFace model) that converts text to vectors, and a vector database or Azure Cognitive Search index to store them. Pseudo-code:

   ```csharp
   foreach (string file in Directory.GetFiles($"/mnt/uploads/{userId}/{repoName}", "*.*", SearchOption.AllDirectories))
   {
       string text = File.ReadAllText(file);
       if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(text)) continue;
       var embedding = EmbedText(text);  // call your embedding function or API
       SaveEmbedding(userId, repoName, file, embedding);
   }
   ```

   Here, `SaveEmbedding` would store the vector along with metadata like userId, repoName, and file path (so you know which file the content came from). You might store this in a database or directly in a vector index. The key is to **track the file paths per user/repo** along with the indexed content. This way, when the user asks a question, you can retrieve relevant files or passages by searching the embeddings, and you know exactly which file and repo they came from.

3. **Maintain sync (optional):** If you want ongoing sync like Claude (which can update when new commits are made), consider storing a reference to the repository (e.g., the GitHub repo URL or commit ID). In a Claude-like integration, you might connect via the GitHub API or webhooks:

   * *Manual re-upload:* The simplest approach is to require the user to upload a new ZIP when the repo updates. Your system then reprocesses it.
   * *GitHub API:* You could use a GitHub Personal Access Token to fetch repository contents directly (e.g., use the GitHub REST API to list files or download an archive). You can store the last indexed commit SHA. On a schedule or via webhook, check if a new commit exists and then fetch new files.
   * *File comparison:* If using the same Azure File Share path for the repo, you could periodically diff the content (though using GitHub API is more straightforward for actual git diffs).

   To emulate Claude, implementing a **webhook** that triggers on push events is ideal. The webhook can call an endpoint in your app with the repo info, and then your app downloads the changed files (or whole repo zip) and updates the embeddings for just those files. This requires more complex integration, so you might start with on-demand uploads and add true syncing later.

4. **Cleaning up and organizing:** It‚Äôs a good idea to organize each upload by user and perhaps by repo or upload timestamp. For example, use a directory structure like `/mnt/uploads/{userId}/{repoName}-{timestamp}` for each upload to avoid collisions. If you extract files on the share, those will occupy space ‚Äì you might decide to keep them for caching (so you don't need to re-extract next time) or delete them after indexing to save space (since you can always re-extract from the ZIP if needed). Azure Files supports standard file operations, so you can delete or move files/directories as needed with `File.Delete` or `Directory.Delete` in .NET after processing.

By following these steps, your application will have for each user/repo: the raw uploaded archive (stored in Azure Files), the extracted repository files (either ephemeral or stored on Azure Files), and an index of embeddings or searchable text. When the user queries something, you search the index for that user‚Äôs repo content, find relevant files, and you could even retrieve the file snippets from Azure Files to feed into the final answer. This architecture closely mirrors Claude‚Äôs approach, where the repo is ingested and then queries are answered based on the indexed knowledge.

## Security and Best Practices

**Authentication & Access:** Azure File Share access in our scenarios uses the storage account key (shared key). Protect this key. Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault rather than hardcoding. If possible, use a **Shared Access Signature (SAS)** with limited permissions instead of the full key ‚Äì for example, generate a SAS token that allows read/write on the specific file share and use that in your app. This limits the blast radius if the credentials leak. Azure Files also supports Azure AD authentication (with Azure AD DS or integration) for on-prem and some Azure scenarios, but using the storage key is the simplest for containerized apps.

**File Security:** Validate and sanitize user uploads. If you allow arbitrary ZIPs, ensure you protect against zip-slip (the code above using `ExtractToFile` is careful to create directories and not write outside the target path). Consider scanning files for viruses or malicious code if your platform is public. Also enforce size limits to avoid extremely large uploads that could exhaust storage or make the app process too much data.

**Permissions:** By default, the mounted share will allow read/write to any process in the container. Within the container, normal file system permissions apply. If running as root, all files will be owned by root. You might consider running as a less-privileged user and adjusting the CIFS mount options (e.g., `uid`, `gid`, `file_mode`, `dir_mode`) to control file ownership. For example, adding `uid=1000,gid=1000,file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770` in the mount options string can make files accessible to a specific user/group in the container. This is especially relevant if multiple services share the same mount with different accounts.

**Scalability:** Ensure the storage account and share are in the same region as your app to minimize latency. Azure File Shares on standard tier have specific throughput and IOPS limits (e.g. up to \~60 MiB/s and 1000 IOPS for a single share by default, depending on size). If you expect heavy concurrent access (many users or large files), consider using **Premium Azure Files** which offers higher performance (with SSD-backed storage). You can switch to a premium FileStorage account which provides better IOPS and throughput, or enable large file share feature if you need more capacity. Monitor the share‚Äôs latency and throughput; if it becomes a bottleneck, you might partition data across multiple shares or storage accounts (for instance, one file share per user or per group of users) to distribute load.

When your app scales out to multiple instances or pods, they **all use the same share** (which is great for consistency, but means all I/O funnels to one storage backend). Design your indexing jobs to handle this ‚Äì e.g., avoid all instances trying to process the same file simultaneously. It might be wise to have a single background worker role handle extraction/indexing tasks, to avoid race conditions. As the Azure docs note: if an app scales to many instances, choose the storage performance tier accordingly to avoid throughput bottlenecks.

**Backup and Durability:** Azure Files is highly durable (with triple replication by default). You can optionally enable Azure File Share **snapshots/backup** to capture versions of the file share data. This could be useful if users accidentally delete data or if you want point-in-time recovery of an uploaded dataset. Also, if your app allows deletion of repos, make sure to clean up the files from the share to save space (and possibly remove associated embeddings from your index to avoid stale data).

**Cleanup and Maintenance:** Over time, users may upload many repos or large files. Implement a strategy to clean up old or unused data. For example, if a user disconnects a repo, you might remove its files after some grace period. Azure Files has a quota per share (you set this when creating the share). Keep an eye on usage; you can increase the quota or create additional shares as needed. Organizing data by user (and maybe by repo) as mentioned will help manage this.

By integrating Azure File Share with your .NET backend in this way, you get a scalable, secure storage solution that works in development and production. You can mount the same share across environments to simplify testing. The result is a system where user data (code and docs) is centrally stored and easily accessible for your RAG pipeline ‚Äì empowering features like ‚ÄúChat with your code‚Äù or intelligent documentation search, much like Claude‚Äôs GitHub integration but custom-tailored to your project.

## 7¬†‚Ä¢ Environment¬†Variables (.env.local.example)

```env
# ‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend ‚îÄ‚îÄ

## 8¬†‚Ä¢ Multi‚ÄëLLM Strategy

1. **Provider interface (`IChatModel`)** implemented for:

   * Azure OpenAI
   * OpenAI (public)
   * Ollama (local Llama¬†3 via gRPC) ‚Äì compile condition `USE_OLLAMA`.
2. In `AgentOrchestrator`, resolve provider based on tenant/user or explicit header.
3. Hot‚Äëswap embeddings likewise.

## 9¬†‚Ä¢ Quick¬†start

```bash
# clone & run
$ git clone https://github.com/yourname/rag-workspace.git && cd rag-workspace
$ cp .env.local.example .env
$ ./scripts/dev.sh   # ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 10¬†‚Ä¢ Next¬†Steps

* Add **PostgreSQL + pgvector** if you need relational + vector hybrid.
* Wire up **Semantic‚ÄëKernel** or **Microsoft¬†Agent¬†SDK** inside `AgentOrchestrator`.
* Harden with HTTPS (Traefik) & Azure¬†Container¬†Apps pipeline (GH¬†Actions).

> You now have a single‚Äërepo, containerised RAG cowork space ready for iteration. üéâ

## 11 ‚Ä¢ Azure¬†File¬†Share Integration¬†‚Äî Implementation Plan

A detailed, end‚Äëto‚Äëend roadmap for adding **persistent, cloud‚Äëagnostic file storage** to Project¬†RAG so users can upload zipped GitHub repos or Markdown docs and the backend can auto‚Äëindex, sync, and serve them.

### üî≠ Mission

> *Provide a seamless, secure, and scalable file‚Äëhandling layer that works the same on local Docker Compose and Azure (Container Apps, App¬†Service, or AKS). The layer should expose an ergonomic `IFileStorageService` abstraction, back it with Azure¬†File¬†Share, and integrate with the RAG pipeline (extraction ‚ûú embedding ‚ûú search).*

      - volumeName: uploads-vol
        mountPath: ${MOUNT_PATH}
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend¬†Code Skeleton

```csharp
// ‚¨áÔ∏è Program.cs
builder.Services.Configure<FileStorageOptions>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("FileStorage"));
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IFileStorageService, AzureFileStorageService>();

// ‚¨áÔ∏è FileStorageOptions.cs
public record FileStorageOptions
{
    public string ConnectionString { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public string ShareName       { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public string MountPath       { get; init; } = "/mnt/uploads";
}

// ‚¨áÔ∏è IFileStorageService.cs
public interface IFileStorageService
{
    Task<Stream> OpenReadAsync(string path);
    Task WriteAsync(string path, Stream data);
    Task DeleteAsync(string path);
    Task<IEnumerable<string>> ListAsync(string dir);
}

// ‚¨áÔ∏è AzureFileStorageService.cs
using Azure.Storage.Files.Shares;
using Azure.Storage.Files.Shares.Models;
public sealed class AzureFileStorageService : IFileStorageService
{
    private readonly ShareClient _share;
    private readonly string _mount;
    public AzureFileStorageService(IOptions<FileStorageOptions> opt)
    {
        var o = opt.Value;
        _share = new ShareClient(o.ConnectionString, o.ShareName);
        _mount = o.MountPath;
    }
    public async Task WriteAsync(string path, Stream data)
    {
        var client = _share.GetRootDirectoryClient().GetFileClient(path);
        await client.CreateAsync(data.Length);
        await client.UploadAsync(data);
    }
    // ... other methods analogous
}
```

### üì° FileUploadController (pseudo)

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/files")]
public class FileUploadController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IFileStorageService _storage;
    private readonly IExtractionService  _extract;
    public FileUploadController(IFileStorageService s, IExtractionService e)
    { _storage = s; _extract = e; }

    [HttpPost("upload")]
    [RequestSizeLimit(250 * 1024 * 1024)] // MAX_UPLOAD_MB
    public async Task<IActionResult> Upload(IFormFile file)
    {
        var userId = User.Identity?.Name ?? "anon";
        var target = $"{userId}/{file.FileName}";
        await _storage.WriteAsync(target, file.OpenReadStream());
        _ = _extract.RunAsync(target, userId); // fire‚Äëand‚Äëforget indexing
        return Accepted(new { path = target, status = "processing" });
    }
}
```

### üèóÔ∏è Extraction & Indexing Pipeline

1. **Download/locate** uploaded ZIP on mounted path.
2. **Unzip** into temp folder under same share (`/mnt/uploads/{uid}/{repo}/extracted/`).
3. **Iterate** files ‚ûú generate embeddings via `EmbeddingService`.
4. **Upsert** vectors into Qdrant with metadata (`userId`, `repo`, `filePath`).
5. **Emit** processing events (SignalR) so UI shows indexing progress.

### üîí Security¬†&¬†Governance

* Enforce MIME & file‚Äësize checks in `FileUploadController`.
* Rotate storage keys nightly; use SAS for dev & Key¬†Vault for prod.
* Configure share quota alerts; clean old data via `RetentionWorker` (runs daily).

### üß™ Testing Strategy

* **Unit tests**: mock `IFileStorageService` with `MemoryStream`.
* **Integration tests**: spin up Azurite File emulator in CI container.
* **E2E**: GitHub Actions job uploads sample repo ‚ûú asserts vectors in Qdrant.

> **Outcome:** Developers can drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop a zipped repo, watch it index, then chat with their code‚Äîall powered by Azure¬†File¬†Share underneath while remaining 100‚ÄØ% compatible in local Docker and cloud deployments.
